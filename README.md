# CryptoClustering

CryptoClustering Challenge :

Use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Within Starter_Code folder:
---------------------------
* Crypto_Clustering.ipynb jupyter file to run main script.
* Resources folder 

Data Source:
------------
crypto_market_data.csv (Resources folder contains source file)

Requirements:
-------------
* Prepare the Data using StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.
* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame.
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
* What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
